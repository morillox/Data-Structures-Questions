Union and Intersection explanation.

In case of union the data will be managed as a set. The union will be executed and then
it will be returned as a linked list again. The same is going to happen for the
intersection, the data will be managed as a set and then stored back in a linked list.

Time complexity will be O(n) and space complexity also will be O(n).
