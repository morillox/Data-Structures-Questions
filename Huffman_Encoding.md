 Huffman encoding
 
 In this exercise I decided, after learning how huffman encoding works, to use 
 a dictionary to storage the codes. I used counter to check on the frequency every char
 was being used. And lastly used trees to generate a unique binary code for each character.
 The decoding happens by using the same mechanic of binary code in the tree.
 
 The time complexity for this problem is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).
