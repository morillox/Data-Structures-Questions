Finding files explanation.

In this exercise recursion is also used to navigate the files. Every path will need to
be checked and storage in a list to check if it exist. 

Time complexity will be O(n!) and space complexity will be O(n * m). Being n the deep 
of the recursion and m the the space of each function call.
